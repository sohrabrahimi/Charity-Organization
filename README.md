# Charity-Organization

A charity organization is interested in running a more effective marketing campaign and maximizing their profit by identifying 
and targeting the possible donors. This project investigates the optimum classification and prediction models that can best 
predict the probability of a household to be donor and the donation amount.

Various classification and prediction models are investigated to find the most suitable classification and prediction models. 
The considered classification models are Logistic Regression, Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), 
K-nearest neighbors (KNN), classification trees, support vector machines. The discussed prediction models include least squares 
regression (LSR), best subset selection, best subset selection using 10-fold cross-validation,Lasso regression using 10-fold 
cross-validation, principal component regression, PLS, GAM, and regression tree.
